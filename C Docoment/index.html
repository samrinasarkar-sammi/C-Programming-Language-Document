                <b>C is very propular language.</b>
                C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of the C language include low-level memory access, a simple set of keywords, and a clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.

            <br>
            <p>Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on the C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Few programs may compile in C, but not in C++). </p>

            <h4>C programming is considered as the base for other programming languages, that is why it is known as mother language.</h4>

                    <li>Most of the applications by Adobe are developed using ‘C’ programming language.</li>

                    <li>It is used to develop databases. MySQL is the most popular database software which is built using ‘C’.</li>

                    <li>It is used for compiler production.</li>

                <h2>Why Learn C Programming?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>As we studied earlier, ‘C’ is a base language for many programming languages. So, learning ‘C’ as the main language will play an important role while studying other programming languages. It shares the same concepts such as data types, operators, control statements and many more.</p>
                <br>

                <ul class="list1">
                    <li>C helps you to understand the internal architecture of a computer, how computer stores and retrieves information.</li>

                    <li>After learning C, it will be much easier to learn other programming languages like Java, Python, etc.</li>

                    <li>‘C’ contains 32 keywords, various data types and a set of powerful built-in functions that make programming very efficient.</li>

                    <li>Opportunity to work on open source projects. Some of the largest open-source projects such as Linux kernel, Python interpreter, SQLite database, etc. are written in C programming.</li>
